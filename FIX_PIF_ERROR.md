# Fix PIF Transfer Session Error

## Error:
```
Could not compute dependency graph: MsgHandlingError(message: "unable to initiate PIF transfer session (operation in progress?)")
```

## Solutions to Try (in order):

### 1. Close Xcode and Clean Build
```bash
# Close Xcode completely first, then run:
cd ios
rm -rf build
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/AnimalDetective-*
cd ..
```

### 2. Clean and Rebuild Pods
```bash
cd ios
pod deintegrate
pod install
cd ..
```

### 3. Reset Xcode Derived Data
```bash
# In Terminal:
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/
```

### 4. Restart Xcode and Build
1. Close Xcode completely
2. Open Xcode
3. Open your project: `ios/AnimalDetective.xcworkspace`
4. Product → Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
5. Product → Build (Cmd+B)

### 5. Alternative: Use Expo CLI
```bash
# Instead of building in Xcode, use:
npx expo run:ios
```

### 6. If Still Having Issues
```bash
# Nuclear option - clean everything:
cd ios
rm -rf build
rm -rf Pods
rm -rf Podfile.lock
pod install
cd ..
```

## What This Error Means:
- PIF = Project Index File
- Xcode is having trouble analyzing your project dependencies
- Usually caused by cached build data or conflicting processes

## Prevention:
- Always close Xcode before running pod install
- Don't run multiple build processes simultaneously
- Clean build folder regularly during development

## Expected Result:
After following these steps, your project should build successfully without the PIF error.
