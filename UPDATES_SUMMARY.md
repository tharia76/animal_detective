### üîä Background Music Fix for Deployed App

**Issue Fixed**: Background music was muting when switching between levels on the deployed app (but not locally).

**Root Cause**: 
- Each level screen was creating its own background music player instance
- When switching levels, the component would unmount and clean up its audio player
- On web platforms, this caused audio context issues and autoplay policy conflicts
- New audio instances couldn't play properly after cleanup

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Created Global Background Music Manager** (`/src/services/BackgroundMusicManager.ts`)
   - Singleton pattern ensures only one background music instance exists
   - Music persists across level transitions
   - Handles web platform audio context limitations
   - Manages volume control and mute states globally

2. **Updated LevelScreenTemplate** 
   - Removed local background music management
   - Now uses the global BackgroundMusicManager
   - No cleanup on unmount - music continues playing
   - Simplified mute/unmute logic

**Benefits**:
- Seamless background music across level transitions
- No audio interruptions when switching levels
- Better performance with single audio instance
- Consistent behavior between local and deployed environments
- Handles web audio autoplay policies properly

**Additional Fixes**:
1. **Fixed music initialization** - Music now plays automatically when entering levels without needing to toggle mute
2. **Fixed dual music playback** - Prevented menu and level music from playing simultaneously by:
   - Cleaning up level music when returning to menu from any exit point
   - Menu screen now stops any lingering level music on focus
   - Added cleanup calls in DiscoverScreen's home button and completion flow

### üéÆ Discover Screen Layout Improvements

1. **Animal Grid Layout Optimization**
   - Changed from 9 animals per row to 6 animals per row on all devices
   - Implemented 5 animals per row specifically for mobile phones
   - Fixed sizing issues where animals were too tiny or too large

2. **Visual Enhancements**
   - Added transparent container for animals grid
   - Improved bottom margins between animal rows
   - Adjusted text label sizes to match new animal sizes
   - Fixed scroll behavior to prevent content from going behind buttons

   - Previously added container with semi-transparent background
   - Fixed overlap issues with scrolling content

   - Only Farm level is now accessible without purchase
   - All other levels (Forest, Ocean, Desert, Arctic, Insects, Savannah, Jungle, Birds) require in-app purchase
   - Maintained unlock functionality for users who purchase full access
