6. **Try again** - When you crash, tap "Play Again" to restart

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components
- **Game Loop** - 60 FPS update cycle using `setInterval`
- **Physics Engine** - Custom gravity and velocity calculations
- **Collision Detection** - Rectangle-based collision checking
- **State Management** - React hooks for game state
- **Animation System** - React Native Animated for smooth bird movement

### Game Constants
- **Gravity**: 0.8 (downward acceleration)
- **Flap Force**: -15 (upward velocity on tap)
- **Pipe Width**: 80px
- **Pipe Gap**: 200px (space between top and bottom pipes)
- **Pipe Speed**: 3px per frame
- **Bird Size**: 60x60px

### Asset Integration

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Sound effects and background music
- Particle effects for visual feedback
- Power-ups and special abilities
- Different difficulty levels
- Multiplayer support
- Achievement system
- More bird characters and customization options

## Performance

The game is optimized for smooth performance:
- Efficient collision detection
- Minimal re-renders using React hooks
- Optimized animation loops
- Memory-conscious asset loading
